# Sentence Count Guardrail Mediator for WSO2 API Manager Universal Gateway

The **Sentence Count Guardrail** is a custom Synapse mediator for **WSO2 API Manager Universal Gateway**, designed to perform **sentence count-based validation** on incoming or outgoing JSON payloads. This component acts as a *guardrail* to enforce specific content moderation rules based on configurable minimum and maximum sentence counts and JSONPath expressions.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Validate payload content by counting sentences
- ‚úÖ Define **minimum and maximum sentence thresholds**
- ‚úÖ Target specific fields in JSON payloads using **JSONPath**
- ‚úÖ Optionally **invert validation logic** (e.g., allow only content *outside* the specified sentence range)
- ‚úÖ Trigger fault sequences on rule violations
- ‚úÖ Include optional **assessment messages** in error responses for better observability

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Java 11 (JDK)
- Maven 3.6.x or later
- WSO2 API Manager or Synapse-compatible runtime

---

## üì¶ Building the Project

To compile and package the mediator:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This will generate a `.zip` file in the `target/` directory containing the mediator JAR, policy-definition.json and artifact.j2.

## üöÄ How to Use

Follow these steps to integrate the Sentence Count Guardrail policy into your WSO2 API Manager instance:

1. **Unzip the Build Artifact**  
   After the build, unzip the artifact generated in the `target/` directory:

   ```bash
   unzip target/org.wso2.apim.policies.mediation.ai.sentence-count-guardrail-<version>-distribution.zip -d sentence-count-guardrail
   ```

2. **Copy the Mediator JAR**  
   Place the mediator JAR into your API Manager‚Äôs runtime libraries:

   ```bash
   cp sentence-count-guardrail/org.wso2.apim.policies.mediation.ai.sentence-count-guardrail-<version>.jar $APIM_HOME/repository/components/lib/
   ```

3. **Register the Policy in Publisher**  
   Use the provided `policy-definition.json` and `artifact.j2` files to define the policy in the Publisher Portal.

    - Place these files in the correct directory structure expected by your deployment process or manually register via REST APIs or UIs.

4. **Apply and Deploy the Policy**
    - Open the **API Publisher**
    - Select your API
    - Go to **Runtime > Request/Response Flow**
    - Click **Add Policy**, select the new **Sentence Count Guardrail** policy
    - Provide the required configuration (name, min, max, etc.)
    - **Save and Deploy** the API

## üßæ Example Policy Configuration

1. Create an AI API using Mistral AI.
2. Add the Regex Guardrail policy to the API with the following configuration:

| Field            | Example                   |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `Name`           | `Sentence Limit Guard`    |
| `Min`            | `2`                       |
| `Max`            | `5`                       |
| `JSONPath`       | `$.messages[-1].content`  |
| `Invert`         | `false`                   |
| `ShowAssessment` | `true`                    |

3. Save and re-deploy the API.
4. Invoke the API's `chat/completion` endpoint with a prompt that violates the sentence count, such as having only one sentence (if min is set to 2):

```json
{
   "messages": [
      {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "This is a short prompt."
      }
   ]
}
```

The following guardrail error response will be returned:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "REGEX_GUARDRAIL_VIOLATION",
    "message": "The request violates the Regex Guardrail policy: 'Regex Prompt Guard'.",
    "assessment": "The prompt contains prohibited instructions."
  }
}
```
